# Flexible Compound Components

## 📝 Your Notes

- If the compound component can have children that need to have access to shared
  state nested at different levels (like this exercise where one is in a div),
  the shared state should be shared through context rather than the
  `React.Children.map()` strategy. That strategy is still valid though, for when
  all the components that need access to the shared state will be direct
  descendants from the element with the state
- To get a better dev tools display name for a context provider, set
  `<context>.displayName`, like in this exercise. Otherwise the default is
  `Context.Provider`

## Background

Right now our component can only clone and pass props to immediate children. So
we need some way for our compound components to implicitly accept the on state
and toggle method regardless of where they're rendered within the Toggle
component's "posterity" :)

The way we do this is through context. `React.createContext` is the API we want.

**Real World Projects that use this pattern:**

- [`@reach/accordion`](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/accordion)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/03.js)
- [Final](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.js)

The fundamental difference between this exercise and the last one is that now
we're going to allow people to render the compound components wherever they like
in the render tree. Searching through `props.children` for the components to
clone would be futile. So we'll use context instead.

Your job will be to make the `ToggleContext` which will be used to implicitly
share the state between these components, and then a custom hook to consume that
context for the compound components to do their job.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 custom hook validation

[Production deploy](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.js)

Change the `App` function to this:

```javascript
const App = () => <ToggleButton />
```

Why doesn't that work? Can you figure out a way to give the developer a better
error message?
